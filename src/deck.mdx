# Core assumptions

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>
          A mechanism for refetching an object.
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of how to page through connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Structure around mutations to make them predictable.

# Object Identification

<ul>

        <li>
          Node Interface that has a non-null ID
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
          All nodes that implements NodeInterface are refetchable

# What is a Cursor?

A cursor is a pointer to a "list"/"connection", it tells you where you are in a list of items

---

# Forward Pagination

first: 10, after: "mycurrentcursor"

This tell GraphQL to return 10 items after "mycurrentcursor" cursor

---
# Backward Pagination

last: 10, before: "anothercursor"

This tell GraphQL to return 10 items before "anotercursor" cursor

---

# Mutations

- It should return all necessary data to update your GraphQL client

---

# Mutations that add a new Node/Edge to the Graph

- It should return the new created edge to be add to existing connections

---

    ShipAdd(input: $input) {

# Mutations that edit an existing Node

- It should return the edited node

# Mutation that remove a Node

- It should return the id of removed node

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Mutation Remove Node"

mutation ShipRemoveMutation($input: ShipRemoveInput!) {
    ShipRemove(input: $input) {
      deletedNodeId

# Pratical GraphQL Tips

This is based on our experience working with GraphQL since their public release at 2015

---

## Avoid Viewer

- Viewer was a "hacky" solution for Relay Classic where you couldn't do query on QueryType
- We recommend use fields directly on QueryType instead, so we can avoid confusion

---

## Keep Logged User on GraphQL Context

- As soon as you know who is logged user, add it to your GraphQL context so you can easily access them in any resolver
- This is also useful to implement viewer can see (security) solutions on resolver based level

---

## Add a me field resolver

- me field on QueryType that resolves to a UserType of the logged user
- This makes it easy to find out who is logged in your app

---

## Each Node should have a load function

- Each type should have an unique way to be resolved
- This will make sure that every resolver is always resolving the correct data
- This also make sure it is easy to add dataloader later on
- UserLoader.load(context, id)

---

## Create a Dataloader generator per database/resource
- Check [GraphQL Mongoose Loader](https://github.com/entria/graphql-mongoose-loader#mongoose-dataloader-batch)
- This make sure all data is resolved in the same way with all optimizations

---

## Create one Connection per database/resource cursor
- Check [GraphQL Mongoose Connection](https://github.com/entria/graphql-mongoose-loader#connection-from-mongoose-cursor)
- This make sure all your connections handle cursor and pagination properly

---

## Follow Relay Mutation Input/Output Object pattern
- Check [graphql-relay](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js)
- With an Input Object type in your mutation it is easy to add more fields without breaking old clients
- The same goes to Output Object type
